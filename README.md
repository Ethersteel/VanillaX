# VanillaX

VanillaX is a mod for Minecraft java edition. VanillaX stands for vanilla expanded and intends to add content that is true to vanilla gameplay.

The main guidelines for the mod are:

    No/Minimal microcrafting
    Recipies should use vanilla ingredients as often as possible
    Machines/Tech should follow vanilla mechanics where they already exist. e.g Cobblestone gen
